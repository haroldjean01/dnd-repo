                    <p>Alchemy Software Development student and avid DND enthusiast, other battle tracker just don't offer what I've needed! Working on this app has taught me a lot as a software engineer, and more updates will be shipped out in the near future. Enjoy!</p>

                    <p>As a software engineer and fellow D&D fan, this app was a pleasure to build! My team and I have used other trackers in the past. Our experience in the past gave us precise direction on how we were looking to improve our new app. Features like our dice roll randomizer and status update effects surpasses what we’ve seen in other apps. Other features that have not been seen before is a player’s page. Our players are able to set up all their statistics and add a profile avatar for their character. You can now track all your battles with ease!

                    <p>I dove into the world of D&D recently and even more recently got into Alchemy. I found that most battle trackers I found online are sorta lackluster, so I wanted to be part of creating this app! I hope you find it just as useful as I do.</p>
