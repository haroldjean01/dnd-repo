Description of the project
Our project was designed by D&D players for D&D players! As the name implies, our app keeps account of all players and enemies statistics for each dungeon and dragon's group. Our app has tons of features like a multi-sided dice roll randomizer and well as recording player's and enemies hp, ac, init and more!
